# Java 3D Engine

## Introduction

---

This is supposed to be an experiment to understand how 3D is implemented from the ground up.
You can find the link to the video I used as inspiration [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhOgJX5PIfY&ab_channel=RyandracusCodesGames)!

## Steps

---

 - [x] Be able to output any colour to a window.
 - [ ] Render a cube on screen.
 - [ ] Map a texture on the cube.
 - [ ] Open other 3D files.

## Delimitation

---

 - The purpose of this project is not to scale it into a big project.
 - There will be comments in order to understand what is happening but these aren't a priority.
